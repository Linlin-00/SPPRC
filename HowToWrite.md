## abstract
The increasing need for safe, inexpensive and quick search, combined with the development of unmanned equipments, has made search missions by a team of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in the spotlight. When avaliable information of search regions are lacking, UAVs make real-time action decisions according to surrounding environments they have perceived. Navigating in an unkonwn area safely is counted as the underlying work which can support the UAVs team for more complex tasks. However, frequent and massive interactions with neighbor UAVs and environments are inevitable for collision avoidance. The task allocation and collision avoid between UAVs are also hard to balance. In this paper, we proposed a method that UAVs can provide assistances to surrounding UAVs by spreading the status information of them. This kind of status information contains ambient infromation and perceptions of the task which are transfered to reward data for convenient and uniform distributions. In other words, individuals utilize inter-neighbor interactions to achieve the same high-level goal, as well as result in an intelligent independent multirobot system. 

with collective efforts.
## introduction
Cooperation and collision avoidance are of equal importance for the multirobot system. When a fleet of robotic agents navigates in a shared workspace, there arised another risk that robots may frequently block each other's ways.

Without a previous knowledge of the searching area, a fleet of robotic agents cannot rely on an unified action plan.
